## What is a CTF ?

According to Wikipedia, 

>**Capture the Flag** (**CTF**) in [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security "Computer security") is an exercise in which participants attempt to find text strings, called "flags", which are secretly hidden in purposefully-[vulnerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing) "Vulnerability (computing)") programs or websites.

A CTF, or Capture The Flag, is a cybersecurity competition (or not) where participants tackle challenges across multiple domains like cryptography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, and more. By finding "flags" within digital environments, contestants earn points by submitting unique strings or files to the competition's scoring system. These challenges, inspired by real-world security scenarios, provide a hands-on platform for participants **to enhance their cybersecurity skills** in a competitive setting.
